Use stubs when you only care about returning specific values.
Use mocks when you need to verify interactions (e.g., method calls, arguments).


Key Highlights of Advanced Examples:

    Stubs:
        Used for passive dependencies (PaymentGatewayInterface) that donâ€™t need interaction verification but need predefined behavior.
        Example: Stubbed the charge method to do nothing for a successful payment.

    Mocks:
        Used for active dependencies (LoggerInterface) where interactions (like method calls and arguments) need to be verified.
        Example: Mocked charge to throw an exception for payment failure and log to ensure proper logging.

    Exception Handling:
        Demonstrates how to handle and test scenarios where a method throws an exception.

    Behavioral Verification:
        Ensures that dependencies behave correctly and interact with the PaymentProcessor as expected.
